## What it does

- **Infrastructure as Code**: AWS CDK for reproducible, version-controlled deployments
- **Automated CI/CD**: Bitbucket and Bamboo pipeline for seamless deployments
- **Enterprise Security**: Windows Authentication with role-based access controls
- **Real-time Sync**: Automated Active Directory data synchronization with PowerShell

## Technical Architecture

**Cloud Infrastructure**

- EC2 Windows Server hosting web application
- VPC with properly configured security groups
- CDK pipeline for infrastructure deployment
- CloudWatch monitoring and logging

**DevOps Pipeline**

- Bitbucket for source control and collaboration
- Bamboo for continuous integration and deployment
- Automated testing and quality gates
- Environment promotion (staging → production)

**Data Management**

- SQL Server for centralized data storage
- PowerShell scripts for automated AD sync
- ADSI integration for user and organizational data
- Scheduled tasks for real-time updates

## Key Challenges Solved

- **Complex Integration**: Built comprehensive API layer connecting multiple enterprise systems
- **Security & Compliance**: Implemented layered security with Windows Authentication while maintaining functionality
- **Reliability**: Developed robust error handling and retry mechanisms for consistent data synchronization

## Impact

- **70% faster deployments** through complete automation
- **99.9% data accuracy** with automated synchronization
- **99.5% uptime** with robust monitoring and error handling
- **Enterprise security compliance** with Windows Authentication standards
