# AI-Powered Analytics Dashboard

A sophisticated analytics platform that combines traditional data visualization with machine learning capabilities to deliver predictive insights.

## Project Overview

This dashboard transforms raw business data into actionable insights using advanced machine learning algorithms and intuitive visualizations.

## Key Features

- **Predictive Analytics**: ML models for forecasting trends
- **Real-time Processing**: Live data streaming and analysis
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Dynamic charts and graphs
- **Custom Reporting**: Automated report generation
- **Multi-tenant Architecture**: Support for multiple organizations

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React with TypeScript for the user interface
- D3.js for custom data visualizations
- Material-UI for component library

### Backend & ML
- FastAPI for high-performance REST API
- TensorFlow for machine learning models
- Pandas and NumPy for data processing
- PostgreSQL for data storage

### Infrastructure
- Docker containerization
- Redis for caching
- Nginx for load balancing

## Machine Learning Implementation

The platform includes several ML models:

1. **Time Series Forecasting**: LSTM networks for trend prediction
